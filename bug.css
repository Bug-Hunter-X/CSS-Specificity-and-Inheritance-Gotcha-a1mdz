The following CSS code snippet demonstrates an uncommon error related to specificity and inheritance:

```css
div {
  color: blue;
}

p {
  color: red;
}

div p {
  color: green; /* This style will be overridden */
}

div p {
  color: inherit; /* This will inherit the color from the parent div, which is blue */
}
```

In this example, the `div p` selector inherits the `color: blue` from its parent `div` instead of applying the `color: green` due to specificity rules. This is because `color: inherit` has higher specificity than `color: green`.

Another case arises when using the `!important` flag:

```css
div p {
  color: green !important;
}

div p {
  color: inherit;
}
```

In this case, `color: green !important` will override `color: inherit`, due to `!important`'s higher precedence.

These situations might not always be immediately obvious, causing unexpected styling results.
