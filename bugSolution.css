Understanding the order of precedence is crucial to resolve the issue:

1. **Specificity:** The more specific a selector, the higher its precedence.  This means that `div p` is more specific than `div`, therefore the style will cascade to the `div p` selector.

2. **Inheritance:** The `inherit` keyword takes precedence over other declarations in CSS if the inherited style has higher specificity than the defined one. 

3. **!important:** The `!important` flag overrides all other style declarations.

To fix the problem, developers should carefully examine their CSS for any selectors that might cause unexpected inheritance behaviors. They should prioritize style specificity and avoid relying solely on the `inherit` keyword unless it's absolutely necessary.

Solutions may include:

* **Using more specific selectors:** Ensure that selectors are specific enough to target the desired elements without relying on inheritance to ensure correct style application.
* **Avoiding `inherit` if possible:**  If you encounter problems with inheritance, it is better to directly define styles instead of depending on inheritance. 
* **Using `!important` judiciously:** This flag should be used sparingly and only when absolutely necessary, as it can make CSS harder to maintain.

The `bugSolution.css` shows an example of how to structure CSS to avoid the unexpected inheritance issue by directly defining the style for the `div p` element instead of relying on inheritance: 

```css
div {
  color: blue;
}

p {
  color: red;
}

div p {
  color: green;
}
```
